            <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
            <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="col-8 col-lg-5 d-block m-auto justify-content-center">
        <hr><p>To beat the opponent (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.</p>
        <p>Part of your strategy is trying to find out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to find out how to stop the opponent from getting three Os in a row.</p>
        <p>After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.</p>
        <p>You also have to watch where the opponent puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the opponent gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the opponent will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</p>
        <p>If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.</p>
